# Primary Key requirements: non of the values can be null, each value must be unique, a table cannot have more than on primary key column.
# WHen a primary key from one table shows up in another table, it is called a foreign key.

# Combining tables using variations of JOIN is important. Here's how it's done:

Select * FROM table_name_one
Join Column
ON table_name_one.shared_column = table_name_two.shared_column;

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM orders
# JOIN subscriptions
# ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

# You can focus the output based on what you are looking for:

Select * FROM table_name_one
Join Column
ON table_name_one.shared_column = table_name_two.shared_column
WHERE table_name_two.column = 'specific item';

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM orders 
# JOIN subscriptions
# ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
# WHERE subscriptions.description = 'Fashion Magazine';

# LEFT JOIN is used to bring together tables even when some rows are missing data when joined.

SELECT * FROM table_name_one
LEFT JOIN table_name_two
ON shared_column = shared_column

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM newspaper 
# LEFT JOIN online 
# ON newspaper.id = online.id;

# You can focus the output based on what you are looking for:

Select * FROM table_name_one
LEFT JOIN table_name_two
ON shared_column = shared_column
WHERE table_name_two.column = 'specific item';

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM newspaper 
# LEFT JOIN online 
# ON newspaper.id = online.id 
# WHERE online.id IS NULL;

# CROSS JOIN(cartesian product) is used to combine two tables in the same way as joining two tables in this way:

SELECT * FROM table_name_one
CROSS JOIN table_name_two;

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM newspaper
# CROSS JOIN months;

# This is the same as:

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM table_name_one, table_name_two;

# Using UNION to combine two or more tables with the same columns to make one table.
# Tables must have the same number of columns, the columns must ahve teh same data types in teh same order as the first table.

SELECT * FROM table_name_one
UNION
SELECT * FROM table_name_two;

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM newspaper
# UNION
# SELECT * FROM online;

# Using WITH is a pain. Basically you are creating a temporary table and joining it with another table.

WITH new_table_name AS (
  SELECT column_one, columnN
  AS 'new_column_name'
  FROM table_name
)
SELECT table_name_two.column, new_table_name.column
FROM new_table_name
JOIN table_name_two
ON table_name_two.primary_key_column = new_table_name.primary_key_column;

# EX:

# WITH previous_query AS (
  # SELECT customer_id, COUNT(subscription_id)
  # AS 'subscriptions'
	# FROM orders
	# GROUP BY customer_id
# )
# SELECT customers.customer_name, previous_query.subscriptions
# FROM previous_query
# JOIN customers
# ON customers.customer_id = previous_query.customer_id;
