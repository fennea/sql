# Primary Key requirements: non ov the values can be null, each value must be unique, a table cannot have more than on primary key column.
# WHen a primary key from one table shows up in another table, it is called a foreign key.

# Combining tables using variations of JOIN is important. Here's how it's done:

Select * FROM table_name_one
Join Column
ON table_name_one.shared_column = table_name_two.shared_column;

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM orders
# JOIN subscriptions
# ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id;

# You can focus the output based on what you are looking for:

Select * FROM table_name_one
Join Column
ON table_name_one.shared_column = table_name_two.shared_column
WHERE table_name_two.column = 'specific item';

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM orders 
# JOIN subscriptions
# ON orders.subscription_id = subscriptions.subscription_id
# WHERE subscriptions.description = 'Fashion Magazine';

# LEFT JOIN is used to bring together tables even when some rows are missing data when joined.

SELECT * FROM table_name_one
LEFT JOIN table_name_two
ON shared_column = shared_column

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM newspaper 
# LEFT JOIN online 
# ON newspaper.id = online.id;

# You can focus the output based on what you are looking for:

Select * FROM table_name_one
LEFT JOIN table_name_two
ON shared_column = shared_column
WHERE table_name_two.column = 'specific item';

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM newspaper 
# LEFT JOIN online 
# ON newspaper.id = online.id 
# WHERE online.id IS NULL;

# CROSS JOIN(cartesian product) is used to combine two tables in the same way as joining two tables in this way:

SELECT * FROM table_name_one
CROSS JOIN table_name_two;

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM newspaper
# CROSS JOIN months;

# This is the same as:

# EX:
# SELECT * FROM table_name_one, table_name_two;
