# This is a file where I help a bank's finance department identify protentially risky transactions before they finish processing.

table name is transaction_data
Columns are: id, full_name, email, zip, ip_address

First I looked at a portion of the tablet to get a feel for what I was working with.

SELECT * FROM transaction_data LIMIT 10;


I have columns id, full_name, email, zip, and ip_address. 
I'm going to be narrowing the list down to a known zip. A simple Google Search 
showed me 20252 is a fake zip provide to Smokey the Bear. #suspicious

SELECT full_name, email FROM transaction_data WHERE zip = 20252;


So far I've found 7 fraudulent transactions... Finance team just told me they 
noticed some Pseudonyms associated with other fraudulent transactions.

SELECT full_name, email FROM transaction_data WHERE full_name = 'Art Vandelay' or full_name LIKE '% der %';


Total found: 21... Doing a little IP protection with this next SQL, but you get the idea ;-)...

SELECT ip_address, email FROM transaction_data WHERE ip_address LIKE 'XX.%';


Total found: 24... found a hit on some disposable email addresses. A little help 
from a cybersec friend, and I have some ideas what to look for... I'm keeping this secret... Sorry peeps!

SELECT email FROM transaction_data WHERE email LIKE '%http://XXXXX.com ';


Found my last one... Puts my total to 25! #idoitforthemoney but its not my money. Hahaha 

SELECT * FROM transaction_data WHERE ip_address LIKE '120.%' AND full_name LIKE 'John%';
