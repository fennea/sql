# Usage Funnels
# I built a funnel from a single table, compared funnels for A/B tests, and created a funnel from multiple tables.


What is a Funnel?
In the world of marketing analysis, “funnel” is a word you will hear time and time again.

A funnel is a marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service. Oftentimes, we want to track how many users complete a series of steps and know which steps have the most number of users giving up.

Some examples include:

Answering each part of a 5 question survey on customer satisfaction
Clicking “Continue” on each step of a set of 5 onboarding modals
Browsing a selection of products → Viewing a shopping cart → Making a purchase
Generally, we want to know the total number of users in each step of the funnel, as well as the percent of users who complete each step.

SELECT question_text, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM survey_responses
WHERE response IS NOT NULL GROUP BY question_text;

question_text	                                                      COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
1. How likely are you to recommend Mattresses and More to a friend?	500
2. Which Mattresses and More location do you shop at?	              475
3. How old are you?	                                                380
4. What is your gender?	                                            361
5. What is your annual household income?	                          270

# If we divide the number of people completing each step by the number of people completing the previous step:
Question	Percent Completed this Question
1	        100%
2	        95%
3	        82%
4	        95%
5	        74%

# We see that Questions 2 and 4 have high completion rates, but Questions 3 and 5 have lower rates.
# This suggests that age and household income are more sensitive questions that people might be reluctant to answer!

# Using GROUP BY, I will count the number of distinct user_id‘s for each value of modal_text. This will tell the number of users completing each step of the funnel. I will sort modal_text so that your funnel is in order.

SELECT modal_text, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY modal_text ORDER BY modal_text ASC;

#Going to look at the control group and see how they funneled to purchase. Using CASE as I will be making another column for the the varient group 

SELECT modal_text,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'control' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'control_clicks'
FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

modal_text	                                        control_clicks
1 - Welcome to Mattresses and More!	                500
2 - Browse our bedding selection	                  301
3 - Select items to add to your card	              239
4 - View your cart by clicking on the icon	        183
5 - Press 'Buy Now!' when you're ready to checkout	152

Compare Funnels For A/B Tests
They’ve set up an A/B test where:

50% of users view the original control version of the pop-ups
50% of users view the new variant version of the pop-ups
We want to answer the question:
How is the funnel different between the two groups?

SELECT modal_text,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
    WHEN ab_group = 'control' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'control_clicks',
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE
  	WHEN ab_group = 'variant' THEN user_id
  	END) AS 'variant_clicks'
FROM onboarding_modals
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

modal_text	                                        control_clicks	        variant_clicks
1 - Welcome to Mattresses and More!	                500	                    500
2 - Browse our bedding selection	                  301	                    394
3 - Select items to add to your card	              239	                    336
4 - View your cart by clicking on the icon	        183	                    264
5 - Press 'Buy Now!' when you're ready to checkout	152	                    227

A/B Tests Results
Modal	              Control Percent	      Variant Percent
1	                  100%	                100%
2	                  60%	                  79%
3	                  80%	                  85%
4	                  80%	                  80%
5	                  85%	                  85%

Result tells us that the variant has greater completion!

Build a Funnel from Multiple Tables

Scenario: Mattresses and More sells bedding essentials from their e-commerce store. Their purchase funnel is:

The user browses products and adds them to their cart
The user proceeds to the checkout page
The user enters credit card information and makes a purchase

First, we want to combine the information from the three tables (browse, checkout, purchase) into one table with the following schema:
browser_date	user_id	        is_checkout	    is_purchase
2017-12-20	  6a7617321513	  True	          False
2017-12-20	  022d871cdcde	  False	          False

 SELECT DISTINCT b.browse_date, b.user_id, c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout', p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase' FROM browse AS 'b'
 LEFT JOIN checkout AS 'c'
 ON b.user_id = c.user_id
 LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
 ON b.user_id = p.user_id
 LIMIT 50;
 
browse_date	  user_id	                                  is_checkout	      is_purchase

I want to query from this funnels table and calculate overall conversion rates.

WITH funnels AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT b.browse_date,
     b.user_id,
     c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',
     p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
  FROM browse AS 'b'
  LEFT JOIN checkout AS 'c'
    ON c.user_id = b.user_id
  LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
    ON p.user_id = c.user_id)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'num_browse', 
	SUM(is_checkout) AS 'num_checkout', 
  SUM(is_purchase) AS 'num_purchase',
  1.0 * SUM(is_checkout) / COUNT(user_id) AS '% browse to checkout',
  1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / SUM(is_checkout) AS '% checkout to purchase'
FROM funnels;

num_browse	  num_checkout	  num_purchase	  % browse to checkout	  % checkout to purchase
775	          183	            163	            0.236129032258065	      0.890710382513661

The management team suspects that conversion from checkout to purchase changes as the browse_date gets closer to Christmas Day.
WITH funnels AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT b.browse_date,
     b.user_id,
     c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',
     p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
  FROM browse AS 'b'
  LEFT JOIN checkout AS 'c'
    ON c.user_id = b.user_id
  LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
    ON p.user_id = c.user_id)
SELECT browse_date, COUNT(*) AS 'num_browse',
   SUM(is_checkout) AS 'num_checkout',
   SUM(is_purchase) AS 'num_purchase',
   1.0 * SUM(is_checkout) / COUNT(user_id) AS 'browse_to_checkout',
   1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / SUM(is_checkout) AS 'checkout_to_purchase'
FROM funnels
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

browse_date	num_browse	num_checkout	num_purchase	browse_to_checkout	checkout_to_purchase

Overal conversion rates:

browse	checkout	purchase	browse_to_checkout	checkout_to_purchase
775	    183	      163     	0.236             	0.890

How conversion rates change as we get closer to Christmas:

browse_date	browse	checkout	purchase	browse_to_checkout	checkout_to_purchase
2017-12-20	100	    20	      16	      0.2               	0.8
2017-12-21	150   	33	      28	      0.22	              0.84
2017-12-22	250	    62	      55	      0.24	              0.88
2017-12-23	275	    68	      64      	0.24	              0.94
Look at the steady increase in sales (increasing checkout_to_purchase percentage) as they inch closer to Christmas Eve!
