What is a Funnel?
In the world of marketing analysis, “funnel” is a word you will hear time and time again.

A funnel is a marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service. Oftentimes, we want to track how many users complete a series of steps and know which steps have the most number of users giving up.

Some examples include:

Answering each part of a 5 question survey on customer satisfaction
Clicking “Continue” on each step of a set of 5 onboarding modals
Browsing a selection of products → Viewing a shopping cart → Making a purchase
Generally, we want to know the total number of users in each step of the funnel, as well as the percent of users who complete each step.

SELECT question_text, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM survey_responses
WHERE response IS NOT NULL GROUP BY question_text;

question_text	                                                      COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
1. How likely are you to recommend Mattresses and More to a friend?	500
2. Which Mattresses and More location do you shop at?	              475
3. How old are you?	                                                380
4. What is your gender?	                                            361
5. What is your annual household income?	                          270

# If we divide the number of people completing each step by the number of people completing the previous step:
Question	Percent Completed this Question
1	        100%
2	        95%
3	        82%
4	        95%
5	        74%

# We see that Questions 2 and 4 have high completion rates, but Questions 3 and 5 have lower rates.
# This suggests that age and household income are more sensitive questions that people might be reluctant to answer!
