# Pulling from table
SELECT * FROM table_name;
SELECT column1, Column2, ... FROM table_name;

# Renaming column while pulling data
SELECT column AS 'New column name' FROM table_name;

# cleaning repetitive data using distinct
SELECT DISTINCT column FROM table_name;
# cleaning data using comparison operators (=, !=, >, <, <=, >=)
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column > control_number; # SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year > 2014

# Pulling data when you have some info about the data within a column.
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE 'unique_info_goes_here';
# "_" means you can substitute any individual character here wihtout breaking the pattern
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column LIKE '%unigue_info%';
# You can use the "%" in any way as it really maens there is unknown data either before or after the percent sign.

# NULL happens in SQL, and I want to work with NULL, such as removing it or keeping it.
# IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
SELECT column[j] FROM table_name WHERE column[i] IS NOT NULL; # Ex: SELECT name FROM movies WHERE imdb_rating IS NOT NULL;

# Using BETWEEN, Letter upper threashold is not <= but rather <. Numbers upper threashold is <= not <. 
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column BETWEEN 'lower_threashold' AND 'upper_threashold';
  #ex: SELECT * FROM movies WHERE name BETWEEN 'D' AND 'G'; # When you want between D and F
  #ex: SELECT * FROM movies WHERE year BETWEEN 1970 AND 1979; : When you want between 1970 and 1979

# As things get more complicated, switching to multiline code

# using AND
SELECT *  
FROM table_name
WHERE column BETWEEN lower_threashold and upper_threashold
  AND column[i] = 'unique_info';
  
#SELECT *
#FROM movies
#WHERE year < 1985
	#AND genre = 'horror';
