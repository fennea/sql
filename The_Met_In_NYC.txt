# I was lucky enough to be able to analyse the artifcats found in The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.

# Tol look at the columns within the database
SELECT * FROM met LIMIT 10;

# To see how many rows were in the database
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM met;

# celery was a large part of life for the wealthy in the 1800s I did a search for pieces that involved the use of celery. Hahaha
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM met WHERE category LIKE '%celery%';

# I wanted to look at the ten oldest pieces of art at The Met, and it turns out there are a lot of old Candle sticks. So to keep it fun,
# I decided to look for distinct titles, so that I could see ten different old items.
SELECT DISTINCT title, medium, date FROM met ORDER BY date ASC LIMIT 10;

# Looking at the top ten countries that provided art to the exhibit.
SELECT country, COUNT(country) FROM met GROUP BY country ORDER BY COUNT(country) DESC LIMIT 10;

# Looked at the top categories of art based on number of items at the exhibit. Turns out there are more bowls than candlesticks.
SELECT category, COUNT(category) AS 'Total # of Items' FROM met GROUP BY category HAVING COUNT(category) > 100;

# Looking for some bling. Checking both Gold and Silver items to see how many they have.
SELECT medium, COUNT(medium) AS 'total' 
FROM met

OR medium LIKE '%silver%'
GROUP BY 1

   ELSE NULL
